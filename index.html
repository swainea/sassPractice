						<h3><span>A problem of advancement</span></h3>
					</header>
					<div>
					<p>
					<span>As</span> I have delved deeper and deeper into <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language Version 5">HTML5</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets Version 3">CSS3</abbr>, it has been difficult to find responsive, well constructed, semantic examples of the two languages.  The <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com">CSS Zen Garden</a> was a website ahead of its time, which is now past its prime.  We need new examples that take into account advancements in time, design, and general web-thought.
					</p><p>
					The original Zen Garden was created at a time when webdesign was polluted with generic divs left and right.  In a time of backlash against <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> table layouts, the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> was a breath of fresh air that gave the internet its first glimpse into the possibilities of fluid, liquid, and modular layouts.  Designers flocked to it, and so the web became a graveyard of unremarkable div elements as part of remarkable designs.
					</p><p>
					The fact that the div had little to no default formatting, made it the perfect subject for designers, along with the fact that there were no other major candidates for layout items of a webpage's structure.  But <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language Version 5">HTML5</abbr> has changed all of that.  With new tags like <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, and  <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, we have finally been afforded an array of elements with which to not only create structures of data, but also structures of layout.

						<h3><span>A solution of education</span></h3>
					</header>
					<div>
					<p>
					<span>Of</span> course, if something isn't broken, why should anyone attempt to fix it?  Especially when the solution won't even be recognizable to some browsers.  If the divs still work and most newer <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language Version 5">HTML5</abbr> elements are completely broken in older browsers (which they are), why should anyone bother learning about, much less implement, such hazardous materials?
					</p><p>
					Well I guess the answer to that isn't an easy one for some people to hear.  especially if those people feel beholden to clients or financiers.  If you learn a new vocabulary word, do you avoid using it, just because some people might not immediately know its meaning?  If it is our duty to better ourselves in our thoughts and our words, so too must the web developers of the world constantly strive to push forward into the next age of the net.
					</p><p>
					Pushing the web forward can be a frustrating task when told that a website must work on all formats, especially when what that really means is not only on different browsers, but on different devices.  It can also be frustrating when not only the standards change, but also the conventions.  Frustrations upon frustrations.  But if anything the horizon looks bright.  Mobile devices have all started fresh, and allowed the standards which wallowed in committee for so long to finally be pushed to the front.  With <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language Version 5">HTML5</abbr> adoption finally reaching a head, it is time to move your clients forward.  No longer do you have to convince someone to embrace the future, now it's all about informing people the future is now.

						<h3><span>A challenge for developers</span></h3>
					</header>
					<div>
					<p>
					<span>So</span> where do we go from here?  My answer is we get away from all the tricks.  We do away with all the glitches, and we drop all the old browsers.  If you've ever seen the movie "Office Space", you probably remember the method with which Milton was fired.  Just stop paying them and eventually things work themselves out.  Well older browsers are the same.  Stop feeding them fixes, and eventually the only fix will be to update.
					</p><p>
					That's where this site comes in.  The original Zen Garden was intended to be an example of <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr> applied to what was simple <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> at the time.  On this page I've attempted to bring that original idea into the current web.  This is not meant to be a forward thinking design challenge.  It's meant to be an attempt to make a website out of the most simple straightforward <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr>, and maybe even Javascript, that is available today.  I've made a fairly simple <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> layout here.  One with plenty of bells and whistles, but none of the pitfalls of generic divs or the specificity of IDs.
					</p><p>
					So the challenge is this.  Take the <a href="http://www.hamiltondraws.com/examples/html5_basic.html">basic <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> page</a> and modify it using all your current <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr> methods.  This basic copy has had all of the classes stripped out of it.  This means that you can construct your classes however you see fit, but you shouldn't have to touch any of the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> structure otherwise.  Make the most aesthetically pleasing design you can, essentially just with <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr>.

						<h3><span>A set of Guide Rules</span></h3>
					</header>
					<div>
					<p>
					<span>Now</span> far be it from me to stifle creativity, but here are some rules, or at least conventions, I think should be followed for this challenge.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
					Try to use as few vendor specific tricks as possible.  Use all the awesome cool current css3, but keep the prefixes to a minimum.  I used a couple linear gradients on this layout, but since they could easily be dropped, I think that's fine for the spirit of the law.  Fixes for older browsers are right out.  Although I consider a certain amount of tag resetting or boilerplating to be fine.
						</li><li>
					Do make good use of modular classes which can be reused.  Projects like <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a> are creating boilerplate class sets, and precompilers like <a href="http://www.lesscss.org">Less</a> and <a href="http://www.sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> are attempting to educate on the wonders of modular classes while proposing the future of <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr> in general.
						</li><li>
					Do consider responsive designs that can handle being on multiple displays.  For instance, this particular design handles 3 different sizes of display.
						</li><li>
					Do explore the exciting effects of the :before and :after pseudo selectors, as well as the :first-of-type, :last-of-type, and :nth-of-type(n).
						</li><li>
					Do attempt some transitions, animations, and transforms.
						</li><li>
					Do check your <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, if you end up editing any, against <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hamiltondraws.com%2Fexamples%2Fhtml5_default.html">a validator</a>.  A major point of this experiment is to not only show exciting <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr> but also well formed <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.
						</li><li>
					A certain amount of javascript should be fine, but remember that the spirit of this challenge is to make something exciting but ultimately simple.  So avoid messing too much with structure, and steer towards using javascript to enhance design.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
					If you take up this challenge, <a href="mailto:hamdiggy@gmail.com">email me your result</a>, and I will start to make a list.  If the list gets to be more than 10 results I will go ahead and make an uploader to ease the process.
